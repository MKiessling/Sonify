/**
 * This AComposer uses the measures given by the sheet music
 * "Der allezeit fertige Polonoisen- und Menuettencomponist" from Johann Philipp
 * Kirnberger as found in [Haupenthal, Gerhard: Geschichte der WÃ¼rfelmusik in
 * Beispielen. Teilband 2: Noten.]
 * 
 * The sheets there were handwritten and were digitized by using the Music OCR
 * (OMR, Optical Music Recognition) software capella scan
 * http://www.capella.de/us/index.cfm/products/capella-scan/info-capella-scan/.
 * 
 * Since the recognition was only 20-70 percent correct, the result was
 * controlled and measure for measure was extracted to MIDI files (can be found
 * in etc/midi/kirnberger.
 * 
 * To generate music, a dice represented by a random generator is used to choose
 * from the set of measures. How exactly the rules are can be read in the
 * quoted book or in the PDF found on www.pian-e-forte.de/noten/pdf/109599.pdf .
